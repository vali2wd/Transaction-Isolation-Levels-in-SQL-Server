The Default: READ COMMITTED (without snapshot)
        - SQL Server enforces this with locks:
        - Writers take exclusive locks on rows they modify.
        - Readers take shared locks to ensure data doesn’t change mid-read.

READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT ON
        - Implemented using row versioning in tempdb.
        - Writers create a new version of rows they modify.
        - Readers under READ COMMITTED isolation automatically read the last committed version (the snapshot) instead of waiting for locks.

Table Hint: WITH (READCOMMITTEDLOCK)
        - Forces a query to use lock-based READ COMMITTED behavior, even if the database is in snapshot mode.

SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
        - This is a session-level setting (only affects your current connection) that indicates the server we are going to operate in READ COMMITTED.

As shown in the queries:
        1. With locking: Snapshot ON, use READCOMMITTEDLOCK to force query into lock-based, even if the db is in snapshot mode.
        2. With snapshot isolation: SNAPSHOT ON, none else. Read query gets the available snapshot stored in tempdb.
